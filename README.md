# CS203 DSAA@Java
## More Solutions to DSAA problems will be uploaded soooooon~~
  
## Hints
1. You can refer to the solution codes there, but make sure the codes are closed when you are writing the code for DSAA problems!  
2. You are sincerely welcomed to contact the author if you have any ideas to help solving these problems on the not-solved list.  
3. Recently, it is found that the FastIO template may cause **MLE(Memory Limit Exceeded)** on the OJ:JCoder, due to unknown reasons. If you face such kinds of problems, please use the following template to read data:  
Read String:  
```
StreamTokenizer tokenizer=new StreamTokenizer(new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)));
tokenizer.nextToken();
String s=tokenizer.sval;
```
Read int/long/float/double: (Using integer as an exmaple)  
```
StreamTokenizer tokenizer=new StreamTokenizer(new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)));
tokenizer.nextToken();
int x= (int) tokenizer.nval;
```
